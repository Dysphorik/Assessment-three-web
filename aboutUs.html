        <div class="aboutUs">
            <p>Great Education Books (GEB) is a local Nelson business which sells textbooks and other
                educational books to students attending local secondary schools and tertiary institutions. They
                currently sell these items using a small shop in town but have decided to move to only an online
                presence to reduce the cost to students. They have decided that the total price per item including a
                delivery charge will be less than having a shop in town.
                Currently the business has an established accounting system to record sales and update inventory
                on hand. This existing accounting system will continue to be used and the new web store will need
                to ensure it provides information which will allow this existing system to be updated. The inventory
                portion of the accounting system contains data about individual stock items held including purchase
                and sale prices, item description, and quantity on hand. There is currently no system to show details
                about who buys items because all sales are based on cash (cash, cheque, credit card, and eftpos)
                transactions. </p>
